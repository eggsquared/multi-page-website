    <p>
      Although many people enjoy drinking alcohol, drinking too much can
      increase the risk of a crash while driving. getting caught driving with a
      blood alcohol level of 0.08 (80 milligrams/100 mililitres) or more will be
      fined up to $1000, have their vehicle seized for 30 days, a 90 day
      liscence suspension, and 12 months using an interlock system which wont
      start the vehicle if the driver has been drinking. on repeat offences this
      penalty will increase. The punishments for drunk driving can be costly so
      it is best not to be caught drinking and driving.
